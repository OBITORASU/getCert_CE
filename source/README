The self-installer will deploy Traversys getCert extension
files, automatically schedule the cron and upload the TPL.

Installation
============
1. Copy the 'traversys_ssl_discovery.run' script to /usr/tideway/data/customer
2. chmod 755 traversys_ssl_discovery.run
3. ./traversys_ssl_discovery.run
4. Enter appliance login when prompted (to upload the TPL pattern)
5. Update configuration options in config.ini file
6. Run cron.sh to setup the cronjob automatically

WARNING: SSL Certificate discovery can be intensive, especially on large subnets.
         Therefore it is advisable to schedule a weekly cronjob, unless you are
         working with a small list of IPs.

Use
===
By default, the script will run a query on the appliance for a list of IP addresses or subnets.
The certificate discovery will commence in the background and export details to an encrypted
data file.

There are 3 modes you can use and are set in the config file:

1 Scan for SSL Certificates on the test ips/subnet string
2 Scan for a list of ips/subnets in the specified input file
3 Run the query (appliance login needed) to export a list of ips/subnets

You must enable appliance self-scanning in order to trigger discovery of the data file.

You can set cron by specifying the schedule syntax in the config file then running cron.sh
at any time.
